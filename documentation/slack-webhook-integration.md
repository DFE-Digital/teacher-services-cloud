# Slack webhook integration

The [Teacher services cloud Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/A05Q1UNM3U2) was created to provide webhooks to all services who need them. Each webhook can send messages to a specific channel.

[The technical guidance](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/infrastructure/monitoring/slack/) shows how to create the app and the webhooks.

There is overhead to create, register and manage the app. In most cases, it's only required to add a webhook.

The infra team can add webhooks or dev teams can be added as collaborators so they can manage their webhooks.

The collaborators list must be kept up-to-date, especially when onboarding and offboarding infra team members.
