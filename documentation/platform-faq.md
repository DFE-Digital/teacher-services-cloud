  ```

  Authorisation failures may be caused by:
  - The federated credential for this environment does not exist
  - The managed identity does not exist
  - The managed identity is not added to the Entra ID group
  - The Entra ID group is missing the role assignement

  The managed identity should be added to the relevant Entra ID group via the `add member` option. If you cannot select this, validate you are an owner. Being an owner is required to add the managed identity to the Entra ID group.

  Error: Login failed with Error: The process '/usr/bin/az' failed with exit code 1. Double check if the 'auth-type' is correct. Refer to https://github.com/Azure/login#readme for more information.
  ```
  The error may be caused by:
  - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID is not correct
  - The service principal doesn't have access to the subscription
